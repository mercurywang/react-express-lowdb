Installed the newest version of `lowdb` at the very beginning, while got errors as below:

```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM] [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: Must use import to load ES Module: /Users/WangZiyu/Projects/mercury/server/node_modules/lowdb/lib/index.js
require() of ES modules is not supported.
```

Perhaps it is the problem that `Node.js` does not support es6 new syntax such as import and ...restParams. Therefore added configs and dependencies:

```js
// server/package.json
"scripts": {
  // before
  "start": "node ./bin/www",
  // after
  "start": "babel-node --presets env ./bin/www"
  },

// added
 "dependencies": {
  "babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
  "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
  "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0",
  "babel-preset-stage-2": "^6.24.1"
}

// server/.babelrc
{
  "presets": ["stage-2"],
  "plugins": []
}
```

Still not working... Had to degrade `lowdb` to v1.0.0.

TODO:

- Update `lowdb` to the most updated version.
- Figure out how to migrate to [Pure ESM package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)

--- 2022/1/23 no way
